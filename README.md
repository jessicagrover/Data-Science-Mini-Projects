# Data-Science-Mini-Projects
This repository features hands-on mini projects covering various aspects of data classification, regression, sampling, and regularization techniques such as Lasso and Ridge, along with Decision Trees. Each project provides practical insights and implementations in Python, focusing on real-world datasets. The classification and regression projects delve into predictive modeling, exploring different algorithms and evaluating their performance metrics. Sampling techniques are demonstrated to handle imbalanced datasets effectively. Additionally, Lasso and Ridge regularization methods are showcased to mitigate overfitting in regression models. Lastly, decision tree algorithms are explored for both classification and regression tasks, offering a comprehensive understanding of tree-based models. These mini projects serve as valuable resources for learning and practicing essential concepts in data analysis and machine learning.
